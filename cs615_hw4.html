				<h2>CS615A -- Aspects of System Administration - HW#4</h2>

				<h3>HW4: tcpdump(1) DNS</h3>

				<h4>Objective</h4>

				<p>
					The objective of this assignment is for you to learn how to use
					<tt>tcpdump</tt> to observe and analyze network traffic.  This
					reinforces lessons from our lecture on networking and prepares
					you for our lecture on the DNS.
				</p>
				<p>In order to be able to observe DNS traffic flowing between your
					host and the DNS root servers as well as other DNS servers, you will need
					to set up and configure a simple caching name server, aka a
					<em>resolver</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Note: you <b>must</b> use <tt>tcpdump</tt>. Graphical helper
          applications such as "wireshark" or similar tools are explicitly prohibited. You
          need to be able to read the flat text tcpdump output yourself
          and not rely on other tools to highlight things for you.</em>
        </p>

				<h4>Summary</h4>

				<p>
					This assignment consists of multiple parts.  Please carefully read the
					assignment in full before you begin.
				</p>
				<p>
					The EC2 AMI to be used in this assignment is '<tt>ami-628ad918</tt>'.
				</p>
        <p>
          This assignment is worth 40 points.
        </p>

				<h4>Part I: traceroute explained</h4>

				<p>Create an instance of <tt>ami-628ad918</tt>.  On it,
					run the command <tt>traceroute www.stevens.edu</tt>; observe the
					ICMP and UDP packets using
					<tt>tcpdump(8)</tt>.  Then, repeat the same process for traceroutes to to
					the following hosts to observe the different routes across the globe
					taken: <tt>www.uni-marburg.de</tt>, <tt>www.uba.ar</tt>,
					<tt>www.hawaii.edu</tt>, <tt>www.hku.hk</tt>, <tt>www.du.ac.in</tt>,
					<tt>www.usyd.edu.au</tt>.</p>

				<p> Use <a href="http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/visual-tracert/">Visual Trace
					Route</a> and <a href="http://en.dnstools.ch/visual-traceroute.html">traceroute on a
					map</a> to map the hops from different starting locations to these
					addresses.  Report anything noteworthy or interesting.  If anything
					appears surprising or non-obvious, research and present an explanation.</p>

				<p>You should submit:
					</p><ul>
						<li>the <em>trimmed and formatted</em> tcpdump output showing
							clearly and <em>only</em> the relevant ICMP and UDP packets
							for one of the traceroutes</li>
						<li>a plain text file noting your findings from the visual
							traceroute</li>
						<li>commentary on what you learned, what you found difficult,
							what you found surprising</li>
					</ul>
				<p></p>

				<h4>Part II: DNS tracing</h4>
				<p>
					You will need at least two instances of <tt>ami-628ad918</tt>, one for
					the DNS <em>server</em> and one to ac as a <em>client</em>.
					Make sure that the firewall rules between the
					server and client allow for all the required traffic.
        </p>

				<h5>DNS server setup</h5>
				<p>
					Set up a caching only DNS server (a ``resolver'') on your OS instance.
					You may consult any online documentation available, such as
					<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/DNS-HOWTO-3.html">this
					document</a> or any others you prefer.  You may use <tt>bind</tt> or
					any other DNS server software you like.  The only restriction is
					that in the end your host must be able to function as a caching DNS
					server.
				</p>
				<p>
					Set up your client host to use your newly created DNS server for
					host lookups.
				</p>

				<h5><tt>tcpdump</tt> exercises</h5>
				<p>
					Use the <tt>tcpdump</tt> utility to monitor the network traffic
					using the following scenarios:
					</p><ol>
						<li><em>on the DNS server</em>, run the following commands:
							<pre>$ telnet www.yahoo.com 80
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.yahoo.com
							</pre>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Track down the packets in your tcpdump referring to the DNS
									query from your DNS server to one of the root servers, then to
									the various DNS servers before the DNS information is returned
									to your server by one of Yahoo's authoritative DNS servers.
								</li>
								<li>
									Identify the 3-way handshake that initiates the
									connection from your DNS server to port 80 on Yahoo's
									webserver, the packets that are being sent back and forth and
									finally the closing of the connection.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<br><br>
						</li>
						<li><em>on your client host</em>, run the following commands:
							<pre>$ telnet www.twitter.com 80
GET / HTTP/1.0
							</pre>
	    				<ul>
								<li>
									<em>On your client</em>: Track down the packets in your tcpdump
									referring to the DNS query from your client host to your DNS
									server.
								</li>
								<li>
									<em>On your DNS server</em>: Track down the packets in your tcpdump
									referring to the DNS query from your DNS server to one of the root
									servers, then to the various DNS servers before the DNS information
									is returned to your server by one of Twitter's authoritative DNS servers.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<br><br>
						</li>
						<li><em>on the DNS server</em>, perform a reverse host lookup
							(<tt>PTR</tt>) for the IP 199.233.217.205;
							track down in your tcpdump all relevant DNS
							queries required to retrieve the result.  Clearly identify
							which name servers you are communicating with and who
							operates them.
					</li></ol>

				<p>You must submit:
					</p><ul>
						<li>a brief plain text description, properly formatted and spell
							checked, of how you set up your DNS server
							and how you configured the client</li>
						<li>the <em>trimmed and formatted</em> tcpdump output showing
							the information requested above; make sure to only include
							the tcpdump lines that are relevat; annotate the lines
							indicating their relevance and meaning
						</li><li>commentary on what you learned, what you found difficult,
							what you found surprising</li>
					</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h3>Deliverables Due Date</h3>
				<p>
					The due date for this assignment is 2018-03-19 16:00 EDT.
				</p>

				<p>
					You will submit a single <tt>tar(1)</tt> archive.  The file to submit
					will be called "<tt>$USER-hw4.tar</tt>" (where "$USER" is your
					username).  The archive will extract all files and subdirectories into
					a directory named <tt>$USER</tt>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please attach the file to an email sent from your <tt>@stevens.edu</tt>
					email address to <a href="mailto:jschauma@stevens.edu?subject=[CS615]%20HW4">jschauma@stevens.edu</a>
					with a subject of "[CS615] HW4".
