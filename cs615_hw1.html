        <h3>HW#1: Setup your environment for EC2 and create an instance</h3>

        <p><em>Please carefully read this document in its entirety.</em></p>

        <h4>Summary:</h4>
        <p>
          The objective of this assignment is for you to set up your
          working environment <!-- on <a
          href="linux-lab.html">linux-lab.cs.stevens.edu</a> -->
          to make it easy for you to interact with the
          <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Compute Cloud</a>.
          In addition to setting up your first instance, you will also
          familiarize yourself with some of the commands relating to filesystems,
          disks and storage as we will discuss in lecture #2.
        </p>
        <p>
          This assignment is worth 15 points.
        </p>

        <h4>Review provided documentation</h4>
        <p>
          Make sure to carefully read through the following documentation:
          </p><ul>
            <li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html">Getting
Started with Amazon EC2 Linux Instances</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">AWS Command Line Interface</a></li>
           </ul>
         <p></p>
	<p>
	<em>Note</em>: some of the documentation you may find on the
	internet may not be up to date,
        find online on your own) may by now be outdated, use
        older tools or be flat out wrong. Do not blindly follow the instructions,
        do not merely copy commands -- you need to show that you <em>understood</em>
        them.
        </p>

       <h4>Set up your environment</h4>
       <p>
           You need to set up your environment for interaction with the Amazon
           Cloud.  You need to create a
           document outlining what steps you took to customize or update your
           setup, such as changes to your shell's startup files, environment variables etc.
           On <tt>linux-lab.cs.stevens.edu</tt> the Amazon EC2 and related cloud
           tools should already be installed; use the <tt>aws</tt>
           command found in <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> -- see <tt>aws help</tt>.
       </p>
	<p>
	(If the tools are not found in that location, please follow the
	user guide linked above to install them under your
	<tt>~/.local/bin</tt> directory via <tt>pip</tt>.)
	</p>
       <p>
          Please note that we will only focus on using the command-line
	   tools for EC2.  That is, nowhere in the process of setting
	things up should you have a need to refer to menu items, or
	which button to click.  This class is command-line all the way.
       </p>

       <h4>Create an EC2 instance</h4>
       <p>
           Create an EC2 instance of <a href="https://wiki.netbsd.org/amazon_ec2/amis/">NetBSD 7.x</a> and start it.
           Once it is running, log in on the virtual host
           and run the required commands to:
         </p><ul>
           <li>display basic system information</li>
           <li>display the partition table</li>
           <li>display the currently mounted filesystems</li>
           <li>display available disk space</li>
         </ul>
           After you are done, remember to shut down your instance.
       <p></p>

       <h4>Deliverables</h4>
       <p>
	Please submit a plain text file containing
	any findings or notes about any issues you had to
	overcome.  Then, please append the output of the following
	commands:
             </p><ul>
               <li><tt>uname -a</tt></li>
               <li><tt>whoami</tt></li>
               <li><tt>date</tt></li>
               <li><tt>w</tt></li>
               <li><tt>ifconfig -a</tt></li>
               <li><tt>netstat -na</tt></li>
               <li>the commands you determine to be used to display the
                      partition table, currently mounted filesystems, disk
                      space</li>
              </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          <em>Note</em>: It is perfectly acceptable to publicly ask (and answer!)
          questions, for example in the <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/forum.jspa?forumID=30">AWS
          Forum</a> or our course mailing list.
