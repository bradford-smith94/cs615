CS 615 HW 4 tcpdump DNS

Part 1: traceroute
==================

I began by recording a typescript log (with timing information) of the session
in case I needed to compare timestamps for when traceroutes were run. Then
capturing all but port 22 (ssh) traffic with tcpdump I ran each of the
traceroutes in the assignment. I ended the tcpdump and the typescript and
shutdown the AWS instance as we did in the in-class example.

To view only ICMP and UDP packets I used the command:
    `tcpdump -n -r <file> udp or icmp`

I opted not to use `-t` in case I needed the timestamps in order to distinguish
which traceroute was which. This ended up not being necessary as I could see the
hostnames in the DNS lookup packets.

The trimmed and formatted tcpdump output for the traceroute to: TODO can be
found in the included file TODO.
