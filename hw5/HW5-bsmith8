The first issue that I needed to overcome was installing curl on the NetBSD
instance. I remembered from FreeBSD earlier in the class that the package
manager was called pkg, so I checked for that and pkg_static, both yeilded a
'command not found'. Running `man -k pkg` pointed me to pkg_add(1).

Reading the manpage for pkg_add I found that the package manager works using
files or FTP URLs, and since I didn't have a file I needed to find the NetBSD
FTP URL for curl. A quick Internet search and I found:

    ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/current/pkgsrc/www/curl/README.html

Which allowed me to find the correct URL to use for my architecture and NetBSD
version. The final command I used to install curl ended up being:

    pkg_add ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/i386/7.0/All/curl-7.58.0.tgz

(Later I ended up finding setenv commands for the PKG_PATH in the default .cshrc
waiting to be uncommented which - if I used csh - would have allowed me to
install using `pkg_add curl`).

Then I used curl to download the data for the assignment:

    curl -k https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/pagecounts-raw/2016/2016-08/pagecounts-20160803-090000.gz >data.gz

I knowingly ignored SSL certificate errors because the assignment specified that
only curl was to be installed and I assumed that to fix this issue I would need
to install something else.
